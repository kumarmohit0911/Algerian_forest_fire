## Introduction

Forest fires have devastating effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and local economies. This project aims to analyze forest fire occurrences in Algeria, leveraging data science techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes meteorological parameters, fire-specific data, and geographical details. Key features include:  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind speed  
- Rainfall  
- Fire occurrence status  

The dataset is divided into two regions: **Bejaia** and **Sidi Bel-abbes**, each with distinct environmental characteristics.

## Tools and Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:  
- **Python**: Primary programming language  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding and exploration  

## Analysis Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values and inconsistencies were handled to ensure accuracy.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations were created to identify patterns, such as the correlation between temperature and fire occurrences.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features were extracted and analyzed to enhance understanding of fire conditions.  

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kumarmohit0911/Algerian_forest_fire.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Algerian_forest_fire
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides critical insights into the factors influencing forest fires in Algeria. Understanding these patterns can guide preventative measures and resource allocation for firefighting and forest conservation.
